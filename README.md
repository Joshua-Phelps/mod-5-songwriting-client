Welcome to Song Control. 

This is a React App I built for my final project at Flatiron School. It uses a Rails API backend with a PostgreSQL database. 

This app was designed to assist songwriters in their creative process. A user can create multiple versions of a song for easy reference and store them in collections for optimal organization. Each song has lyric formatter using the JavaScript library ChordSheetJS that places chord changes above the words and a tool to look up synonyms, rhymes, and definitions for a chosen word.
